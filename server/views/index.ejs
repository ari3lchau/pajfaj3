      <p><b>PAJFAJ</b> is a Canada-based innovative startup company that focuses on doing surveys for new international students in Canada in order to enhance their experience.
        We believe that surveys are a great way to know how these students think and feel about living in a new country. Therefore, with the use of our surveys, we get to understand these students better to help and guide them throughout their journey in Canada.
